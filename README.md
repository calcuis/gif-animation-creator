## gif animation compiler

The provided Python code utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module to create a GIF animation from a sequence of input images. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing the PIL Module:
```
from PIL import Image
```
This line imports the Image module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The Image module provides functionality for working with images.

Defining Input and Output:
```
input = ['1.png', '2.png', '3.png']
output = 'output.gif'
```
The code specifies a list named input containing file names ('1.png', '2.png', '3.png') of input images, and a string output with the desired output file name ('output.gif') for the GIF animation.

Creating Frames List:
```
frames = []
for file in input:
    img = Image.open(file)
    frames.append(img)
```
A list named frames is created to store individual frames of the GIF animation. A loop iterates through each file in the input list, opens the image file using Image.open(), and appends the image object to the frames list.

Saving the GIF Animation:
```
frames[0].save(output, save_all=True, append_images=frames[1:], duration=500, loop=0)
```
The first frame of the frames list is used as the base frame. The save() method is called on this frame to save the GIF animation. The parameters are as follows:
- output: The output file name ('output.gif').
- save_all=True: Specifies that all frames in the frames list should be saved.
- append_images=frames[1:]: Appends the remaining frames (starting from the second frame) to the base frame.
- duration=500: Sets the duration (in milliseconds) for each frame to be displayed. In this case, each frame will be displayed for 500 milliseconds (or 0.5 seconds).
- loop=0: Specifies the number of loops for the GIF. A value of 0 means infinite looping.

In summary, the code reads a sequence of input images, creates a list of frames, and then saves these frames as a GIF animation with specified parameters.
